## Project Vision
The vision of CustomizedLearningNFT is to provide a secure and customizable platform where creators can easily mint, list, and sell NFTs while giving buyers the opportunity to purchase unique digital assets. This project aims to empower creators by giving them full control over their NFTs and ensuring transparent ownership and transactions on the blockchain.

## Key Features

- **Create NFT:** Users can create a new NFT by specifying a name, metadata URI, and price. The NFT is assigned a unique ID and stored on the blockchain.
  
- **List NFT for Sale:** NFT creators can list their NFTs for sale by setting a price. The NFT will become available for purchase by others.
  
- **Remove NFT from Listing:** NFT creators can remove their NFTs from listing at any time, making them unavailable for purchase.
  
- **Purchase NFT:** Users can purchase NFTs listed for sale by sending the correct amount of Ether. The transaction is recorded on the blockchain, and the NFT ownership is transferred to the buyer.
  
- **View NFTs by Owner:** Users can view all NFTs owned by a particular address.
  
- **View NFT Details:** Anyone can view the details of a specific NFT, including its name, metadata URI, price, and creator.
